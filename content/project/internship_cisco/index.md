Collaborated with the lead system architect and other engineers to 

* Integrate bare-metal servers with OpenStack for CISCO programmable fabric. This involved the design of a new system architecture for seamless deployment of bare-metals side-by-side with the Virtual Machines. This system was converted into a product later on.

* Participate in the discussions of the Openstack open-source community and their chat rooms to determine the right course of actions.
