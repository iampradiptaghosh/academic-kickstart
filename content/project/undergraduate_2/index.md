Developed a set of optimization tools to contribute the field of evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and applied them toward solving complex real world problems. This project involved
 
* Hybridization of Various Unimodal & Multi-modal Optimization Algorithms to Develop New Improved Algorithms   

* Study of Various Evolutionary Algorithms in Optimizing Antenna Structures  and Antenna Array Design Using Optimization Algorithms Like DE and PSO
