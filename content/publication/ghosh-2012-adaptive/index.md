abstract: "This paper proposes an improved and adaptive variant of the differential evolution algorithm for the design of two-channel quadrature mirror filters with linear phase characteristics. To match the ideal system response characteristics, the algorithm is employed to optimize the values of the filter bank coefficients. The filter response is optimized in both passband and stopband. The overall filter bank response aims at minimizing objectives like reconstruction error, mean square error in passband, and mean square error in stopband. Effective designing can be achieved by efficiently minimizing the objective function. The proposed algorithm is able to perform better than the other existing design methods. Five different design examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over other conventional design techniques, as well as state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms found in the literature"
