abstract: "We present a proof-of-concept low-power IEEE 802.15.4 standard based bistatic radar system for localizing unknown radio-wave reflecting objects in an unknown environment. Unlike prior multiantenna based approaches, we employ a single standard low power omnidirectional transmitter with known transmission parameters and a single rotating directional receiver antenna to collect a set of directional RSSI samples and, thereafter, exploit the directionality information of the samples to determine the locations of the reflecting objects. To this end, we employ the well-known Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) to extract required information from the collected RSSI samples. To test the concept, we have developed a real hardware prototype of the system. Through a set of simulation and real experiments, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed concept. To our knowledge this is the first bistatic radar system demonstrated with low cost low power off-the-shelf 802.15.4 radios."
