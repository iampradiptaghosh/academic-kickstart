abstract: "CIRCE (CentralIzed Runtime sChedulEr) is a runtime scheduling software tool for dispersed computing. It can deploy pipelined computations described in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) on multiple geographically dispersed compute nodes at the edge and in the cloud. A key innovation in this scheduler compared to prior work is the incorporation of a run-time network profiler which accounts for the network performance among nodes when scheduling.  This demo will show an implementation of CIRCE deployed on a testbed of tens of nodes, from both an edge computing testbed and a geographically distributed cloud,  with real-time evaluation of the task processing performance of different scheduling algorithms"
